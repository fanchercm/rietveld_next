# Codex Prompt: Issue #324 — Add benchmark regression baseline mechanism

## Objective

Complete GitHub issue `#324`: **Add benchmark regression baseline mechanism**.

## Repository guardrail

All implementation source code must live under `src/`. Do not create top-level implementation directories such as `core/`, `diffraction/`, `xray/`, `neutron/`, `tof/`, `edxrd/`, `optimization/`, `workflows/`, `ai/`, `hpc/`, `desktop/`, `web/`, `benchmarks/`, or `tests/`. Documentation may live under `docs/`, backlog files under `backlog/`, GitHub import payloads under `github/`, schemas under `schemas/`, prompts under `prompts/`, and scaffold notes under `scaffold/`.

## Issue metadata

- Category: `Benchmarking`
- Phase: `Benchmark Infrastructure`
- Priority: `P1`
- Labels: `benchmarking, ci, codex-ready, performance, regression`

## Dependencies

- #289
- #290

## Scope

Add a mechanism to store and compare benchmark baselines without making normal CI fail on noisy performance changes by default.

## Description

Implement or specify `Add benchmark regression baseline mechanism` as part of the Rietveld Next benchmarking workstream. Keep the change small, reviewable, deterministic, and aligned with the `src/`-first repository layout.

## Required deliverables

- Baseline file format
- Comparison utility
- Documentation

## Acceptance criteria

- Utility compares current results to baseline and reports percentage changes.
- Default behavior warns rather than fails unless explicitly configured.
- Baseline files include environment metadata and benchmark version.
- All implementation source is placed under `src/`; no forbidden top-level implementation directories are created.
- Benchmark can be skipped or constrained in normal CI so expensive workloads do not run by default.
- Results are reproducible with fixed seeds, explicit dataset sizes, software versions, and hardware metadata where available.

## Implementation instructions

1. Keep the change small enough for a focused pull request.
2. Prefer extending existing files and APIs over creating parallel duplicate implementations.
3. Add or update tests where the issue changes behavior.
4. Add docs or examples when the issue introduces a public interface or workflow.
5. Do not run expensive benchmarks or validation cases in default CI unless the issue explicitly requires it.
6. Keep generated artifacts deterministic.
7. Verify no forbidden top-level implementation directories were created.

## Final response requested from Codex

Report:

- Files changed.
- Tests run.
- Acceptance criteria satisfied.
- Remaining work or follow-up issues.
